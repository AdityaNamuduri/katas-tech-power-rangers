## Architectural Characteristics
The key properties and features that describe the design and behavior of The Road Warrior

#### Security:
Why Chosen: Security is of paramount importance because the application will handle sensitive user data, including personal information and travel details. Travelers need assurance that their data will be protected from unauthorized access, breaches, and cyber threats. Implementing robust security measures is essential to build trust and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

#### Scalability:
Why Chosen: Scalability is critical because your MVP aims to serve 2 million active users per week out of a total of 15 million users. To accommodate rapid user growth and varying levels of traffic, a scalable architecture is necessary. It ensures that the system can handle increased loads without performance degradation or downtime, providing a smooth user experience.

#### Performance:
Why Chosen: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction. Travelers expect a responsive and fast application when managing their trips. Implementing performance optimization measures, such as caching, CDN usage, and efficient database queries, ensures that the system delivers quick response times, even during peak usage periods.

#### Reliability:
Why Chosen: Reliability is crucial because travelers rely on the system to access their travel information, which can be time-sensitive. Unreliable systems can lead to frustration and disruptions in travel plans. Redundancy, failover mechanisms, and real-time monitoring ensure that the system remains available and dependable.

#### Availability:
Why Chosen: Availability is key to providing uninterrupted service to users. Travel management can happen at any time, and downtime can lead to inconvenience for travelers. High availability architecture, geographical redundancy, and adherence to service level agreements (SLAs) ensure that the system is accessible when users need it.

#### Elasticity:
Why Chosen: Elasticity complements scalability by allowing the system to adapt to changing demands in real-time. It ensures efficient resource allocation and cost optimization. Elasticity enables the system to handle sudden traffic spikes without overprovisioning, which can be cost-effective in a dynamic environment.

#### Recoverability:
Why Chosen: Recoverability is essential to minimize data loss and downtime in case of unexpected events, such as hardware failures, natural disasters, or cyberattacks. Data backup, disaster recovery planning, and backup systems provide a safety net to quickly restore operations and minimize disruptions.

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR 1: React Native for Mobile and SPA for Web
- Decision: Use React Native for mobile app development and a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture for the web application.
- Rationale: React Native offers a rich user interface and enables code reuse across platforms. SPA architecture provides a smooth user experience.

### ADR 2. Microservices Pattern
- Decision: Microservices pattern as the foundation for our architecture.
- Rationale: Independently deployable each service typically has its own source code repository and its own deployment pipeline, which builds, tests and deploys the service.This pattern was chosen to ensure that our architecture is well-structured, scalable, and easy to manage.

### ADR 3. Serverless
- Decision: To adopt serverless computing as an architectural approach for developing and deploying components of our applications.
- Rationale: Adoption of serverless computing reduces infrastructure management overhead, achieving auto-scalability, and optimizing costs. It allows us to focus on code development while the cloud provider manages infrastructure scaling and availability.

### ADR 4. 3rd Party Analytics
- Decision: To integrate third-party analytics services, specifically Google Analytics, into our application architecture.
- Rationale: Integrating a third-party analytics service allows us to gain deep insights into our application's performance and user behavior. It enables travel agencies and airline, hotel, and car rental companies to respond to issues in real-time, enables them to plan their marketing strategies and offer the customers better experience.

### ADR 5. Database
- Decision: We have decided to use MySQL as the RDBMS for the project.
- Rationale: We chose this type of database because our project's data structure is well-suited to tabular, structured data.MySQL provides strong ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity, consistency, and transactional reliability. MySQL offers scalability options, including the ability to horizontally scale through sharding or clustering to accommodate increased data volumes and user loads.

### ADR 6. Internationalization
- Decision: Internationalization is crucial to ensure that the application is accessible and user-friendly for a global audience.
- Rationale: It enables users from different regions to interact with the application in their preferred language and format. We will determine the user's preferred language based on browser settings or user preferences collected during user registration. This will ensure that users are presented with content in their preferred language by default. To handle locale-specific date, time, currency, and numeric formatting, we will utilize the localization features provided by i18next and ResourceBundle. This will ensure that data is presented correctly based on the user's locale.
